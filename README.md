# AutobuildTest

A near empty project used for testing continuous integration technologies such as:
-Github Actions
-Unity Cloud
-Fastlane

Here, the code isn't the project itself, but the Actions setup is.

Tests have been done for Ios, Windows Standalone and Android builds, and artifact management.
